# Todoey

Clean, simple, and colorful todo list app.

I expanded upon the Todoey project app from Angela Yu's iOS development course on Udemy to create this app.

## Installation

Install CocoaPods. Run `pod install` to install pods.

## Usage

Use the plus button to create lists or todos.
Swipe to delete lists or todos.
Tap a todo to toggle completion.
Your lists are saved locally with Realm.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are CocoaPods.

* ChameleonFramework
* SwipeCellKit
* RealmSwift
